# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Author: Bill Zichos (billzichos@hotmail.com)

I use this repository to store apps that help in the processing of natural language for sentiment analysis, text classification, or tagging.  A majority of my NLP tasks are written in Python.

## Basic NLP Feature Gathering
* Word Count
* Sentence Count
* Lexical Diversity

## Text Classification
The first generation of my text classification will be used to classify whether or not a text request for a free pizza is compelling enough for someone to fulfill.

## Word Sentiment List
I created a dictionary to store positive and negative words to be used in keyword searches in a sentiment analysis.  Words are flagged as either having a "Positive" or "Negative" sentiment.
