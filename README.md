# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Author: Bill Zichos (billzichos@hotmail.com)

I use this repository to store apps that help in the processing of natural language for sentiment analysis, text classification, or tagging.  A majority of my NLP tasks are written in Python.

## Basic NLP Feature Gathering
* function 1 {}
* function 2 {}
* function 3 {}

## Word Sentiment List
I created a dictionary to store positive and negative words to be used in keyword searches in a sentiment analysis.  Words are flagged as either having a "Positive" or "Negative" sentiment.
